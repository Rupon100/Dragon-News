## Project Overview
Dragon News is a website that categorizes and displays news articles. In the header, you’ll find a "Latest News" section that, when clicked, navigates to detailed information on the latest news. The Navbar features a name or email on the left, navigation links in the center, and a login/logout button with a profile icon on the right.

If a user attempts to log in without registering, an error message is displayed. Upon successful login, the user’s information is shown on the Navbar. The main section is divided into three columns: categories on the left, news in the center, and additional information (such as social login, social links, and an ads section) on the right.

If there’s no data available in a selected category, a "No data available" message appears. For invalid URLs or links, an error page is displayed with a button to return to the homepage.

## Technology I Used
